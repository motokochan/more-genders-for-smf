More Genders
by Motoko-chan


About
-----
SMF has supported the selection of your gender since it was released, but only
recognized two genders: male and female.

However, not everyone uses these labels, and with gender reassignment, labels
have become a bit more complex.

This modification allows the selection of more genders. Currently, it supports
transgendered (both ways) and intersexual as additional options. If more are
brought to my attention, they will be added as well.

Features
--------

Known Issues
------------
- The Male/Female ratio stastic will be inaccurate due to the way SMF
  determines the genders for this stastic.

----------
Additional genders to select will be avilable in the profile area.
